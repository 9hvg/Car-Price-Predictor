# Car Price Predictor

## Project Overview

This project involves building a **regression model** to forecast the prices of used cars based on various features from the **Quikr dataset**. The model was designed to predict car prices using parameters such as brand, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, etc. The project involved rigorous data preprocessing to ensure the model's robustness and reliability.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing data and performed feature scaling to prepare the data for model training. Applied **column transformers** for effective preprocessing.
  
- **Regression Model**: Built a regression model using **Linear Regression** to predict car prices based on input features.

- **Pipelines**: Used **pipelines** to streamline the entire process, from data preprocessing to model training, ensuring clean and efficient code execution.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For Linear Regression, Column Transformers, Pipelines, and evaluation metrics.
- **Quikr Dataset**: Dataset used for car price prediction.
